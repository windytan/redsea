# redsea changelog

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT (HEAD)

* Major new features:
  * Add RDS2 streams / RFT support (#32): --streams

## 1.1.1 (2025-03-03)

* Bug fixes:
  * Fix a regression in 1.1 that caused the groups to sometimes not appear
    immediately after reception (#126)
* Build system changes:
  * Catch2 is an optional build dependency (building tests is optional)

## 1.1 (2024-12-28)

* New features:
  * Decode 'broadcaster use' data in Slow labeling codes (variant 6)
  * Decode 'decoder identification' bits in Group 15B
  * Workaround buggy encoders that show 1 extra character in RT+ fields
* Bug fixes:
  * Fix a crash when the input file has a very high sample rate (fuzz)
  * Fix a crash from uncaught iconv exceptions from corrupted utf8/ucs2 data (fuzz)
  * Fix the CSVReader (used in the TMC decoder) ignoring the last line of any file
  * Remove extra trailing space in transparent data channels hexdump
  * Make raw libsndfile errors user-friendlier (instead of saying 'System error')
* Build system fixes:
  * macOS: ask Homebrew about liquid-dsp location instead of hardcoding it
  * Set default installation prefix to /usr/local (all platforms)
  * Reduce compiler workload somewhat with forward declarations

## 1.0.1 (2024-07-19)

* Fixes:
  * Fix a crash (uncaught json exception) when attempting to serialize a string that's
    invalid UTF-8, e.g. if long PS gets corrupted
  * Fix build when the installed version of nlohmann-json is too old (#113)
  * Fix a couple of integer overflows, one affecting the subcarrier reset functionality
    after 3.5 hours of runtime and another one after 41 days of constant data

## 1.0 (2024-06-27)

* New features:
  * Add support for Enhanced RadioText (eRT)
  * Add support for Long PS in Group 15A (#104)
  * Add runtime option `--no-fec` for disabling error correction
* UX changes:
  * Breaking: Print a warning to stderr if the raw MPX input sample rate is
    not specified (breaks the previous silent assumption of 171 kHz)
  * Improve error reporting in general
  * Add `--output hex` (same as `--output-hex`) to mirror `--input hex`
* Fixes:
  * Fix detection of invalid date/time (timestamps >2000 years ago)
  * Noise resistance improvements (#106):
    * Require three (instead of two) repeats of a new PI before accepting it
    * Require three (instead of two) synchronization pulses before locking
* Maintainability:
  * Migrate build system from autotools to meson (#90)
  * Switch from patched, packaged-in JsonCPP to external nlohmann-json (#109)
    * Breaking: The order of some JSON elements has changed (insertion order
      instead of alphabetical)
  * Add automated CI builds for macOS, Windows (MSYS2/MinGW + Cygwin), Ubuntu-latest,
    Debian Buster
  * Add Debian packaging (#101)
  * Add basic Catch2 unit tests (#84)
  * Add .clang-format (not automated)
  * Remove unmaintained build options for non-liquid, non-TMC builds
  * Fix compiler warnings, issues identified via static analysis, and other code cleanup

## 0.21 (2024-01-26)

* Add support for decoding LTCC and LTECC in TMC (#80)
* Add support for decoding RDS output from the TEF6686 tuner (#89)
* Add support for Alternative Frequencies Method B (#88)
* Breaking: Change the name of the field `alt_kilohertz` to either
  `alt_frequencies_a` or `alt_frequencies_b`. The type of data sent by these
  methods differs. When `--show-partial` is set, the AF list will be in
  `partial_alt_frequencies` regardless of method.
* Add option `--input` / `-i` to specify the stdin input format (bits, hex,
  mpx, tef). The old options will still work.
* Fix automake script on Windows (#81)
* Fix compatibility with current liquid-dsp (#78)
* Fix output for UTF-8 encoded TMC location tables (#82)
* Fix `clock_time` displaying wrong date around midnight (#83)
* Fix misinterpretation of the Decoder Identification bits (#87)
* Fix decoding of RadioText for stations that don't use string terminators
  (#77)
* Fix an off-by-one bug in the RadioText decoder that sometimes caused missing
  characters at the end of messages
* Fix runaway PLL after digital silence by clamping the phase error (#94)

## 0.20 (2021-03-08)

* Recognize more ODAs and features - thanks Andreas Mikula
* Add support for PTY names (group 10A)
* Add partial support for DAB cross-referencing (ODA 0x0093)
* Add support for raw broadcaster data in EON (variant 15)
* Add support for transparent data channels (groups 5A, 5B)
* Add support for fractional seconds in the rx timestamp format (`%f`).
* Add support for TMC tuning info variant 8
* Add buffer delay compensation to rx timestamps. Timestamps aim to represent
  the time the PCM samples were read in.
* Place some JSON fields in the beginning of the line for easier visual
  inspection (pi, group, ps...)
* Print raw ODA data if the application is not supported

## 0.19 (2020-04-06)

* Add option `--show-raw` (`-R`) for including the raw group data as a hex
  string in the JSON output
* Print usage help if there are non-option arguments on the command line
* Fix uninitialized block error rate values on some systems
* Update jsoncpp from 1.8.1 to 1.8.4 to fix some warnings

## 0.18 (2019-05-19)

* Add support for loading multiple TMC location databases by specifying
  `--loctable` more than once.
* Sample rate can also be specified as `-r 171k` instead of `-r 171000`.
* Fix a crash if the input audio file couldn't be loaded.
* Print usage help instead of error message when stdin is empty.
* Speed up loading of TMC location database.
* Improve block sync detection by ignoring spurious sync pulses.
* Fine-tune filter bandwidths for better sensitivity, based on test runs.
* At EOF, process the last partially received group.
* Remove character codetables G1 and G2 since they don't appear in the latest
  RDS standard any more.
* Clean up code to ensure maintainability. Redsea now requires a compiler
  that supports C++14.

## 0.17.1 (2018-06-08)

* Fix: Return exit value 0 if `--version` or `--help` was requested
* Don't open stdout for libsndfile unless `--feed-through` was specified,
  otherwise json can't be written (this may break the feed-through on Linux
  temporarily)

## 0.17.0 (2018-06-05)

* Change the type of the JSON field for TMC message urgency, from integer
  (0, 1, 2) to string ("none", "U", "X")
* Speed improvements by avoiding a few extraneous buffer copies internally

## 0.16.0 (2018-03-27)

* Add support for multi-channel signals (`--channels`) - libsndfile is now
  a required dependency
* Speed improvements:
  * By using a lookup table instead of sinf/cosf to generate the
    mix-down sinusoid
  * By only using one mix-down operation instead of two

## 0.15.0 (2018-01-31)

* Add `prog_item_number` field containing the raw Program Item Number
* Add `partial_alt_kilohertz` field containing an incomplete list of
  alternative frequencies when the `--show-partial` option is used
* Add configure option `--without-macports` to disable directory checks
  when cross-compiling
* Reduce write calls to output JSON stream using a stringstream (#56)
* Remove an old shell script that launches `rtl_fm` - instead, there is
  a mention of `rtl_fm` usage in the readme and wiki

## 0.14.1 (2017-12-08)

* Change the `callsign` object name to `callsign_uncertain` when a station's PI
  code begins with a 1
* Fix UTC+14 getting marked as invalid (it's the time zone in Kiribati)
* Fix syntax errors in schema

## 0.14.0 (2017-11-14)

* Add support for decoding call sign letters from North American (RBDS)
  stations - activated by the `-u` switch

## 0.13.0 (2017-09-19)

* Change the JSON structure in `radiotext_plus`: RT+ tags are now displayed as
  an array of objects with content-type and data:
```json
"radiotext_plus":{
  "tags":[
    {"content-type":"item.artist",
     "data":"SeeB feat. Neev"},
    {"content-type":"item.title",
     "data":"Breathe"}
  ]
}
```

  `"frequency":"87.9 MHz"` to `"kilohertz":87900`

  option in the usage help
